# spin-head

This project is a simple application that allows users to load and view 3D models
using Pygame and OpenGL. The application provides an interactive window where users
can rotate the 3D model using the mouse. It supports OBJ file format for loading models
and uses shaders for rendering.

The 3D model provided is sculpted in Blender based on a self-defined Memoji on an iPhone.
